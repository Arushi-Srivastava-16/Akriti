  "raw_text": "The balcony is a nicety attached to the master bedroom, providing some outside space approx. 36 sq ft in size. The bathroom is in the back corner of the unit, next to the kitchen space. It is across the living space and across from the second common room, and is fairly spacious at 30 sq ft. The first common room is just to the right of the door, next to the master bedroom. It is fairly roomy at 100 sq ft and overlooks part of the balcony. The second common room is just beyond the master bedroom and is fairly sizeable. It is similar to the first common room at 100 sq ft, but does not share the balcony. It is across the living space from the bathroom. The kitchen is connected to the living room and is next to the bathroom. It is approx. 25 sq ft. The living room takes up the majority of the space of the center of the unit. It is approx. 110 sq ft and is connected to the kitchen and provides direct access to the bathroom. It is L-shaped in nature, with a larger area off the kitchen. The master bedroom has its own connected balcony, and is in the middle of the unit, flanked by both of the common rooms. The master bedroom is approximately 100 sq ft in size.",
