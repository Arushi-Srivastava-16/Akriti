  "raw_text": "The balcony only intersects with the master room, and is the smallest one of all. It measures at 10X2 feet, and is in the perfect placement for the owners to use when needing to unwind for the day to read a book. The bathroom measures at 10X10, and intersects with the kitchen and living room. It sits atop the living room and to the right of the kitchen, making for quick access for guests when they visit. The common room measures at 10X10 feet and is below the living room and to the left of the master room. It does not intersect with any other rooms. The kitchen measures at 10X10, and intersects with the bathroom and living room. It sits atop the living room and to the left of the bathroom, making for easy access for grabbing items when guests visit. The living room is in the center of everything, measuring at 20X12 feet in size. It's the main room that touches all other rooms (master, common, kitchen, and bath) except for the balcony. The master room measures at 10X12 feet and is below the living room, to the right of the common room, and right above the balcony.",
