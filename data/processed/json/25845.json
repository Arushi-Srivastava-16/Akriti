  "raw_text": "Bathroom 1 is tiny. It looks to be a 5'x8' room.  Why are there 2 bathrooms touching one another?  I would think it would be better suited as a pantry for the kitchen. Both bathrooms are located on the Eastern wall of the home. Bathroom two is only a tiny bit bigger than the first.  It's located in the southeast corner of the home.  It looks to be about  six feet by 7 feet. The common room is approximately 11 feet by 12 feet.  It is located on the north western corner of the home, next to the master bedroom. The kitchen is approximately 7 feet wide by 14 feet long.  It's touching the living room and bathroom. the kitchen is in the northeastern corner of the home. The living room is extremely spacious, ar about 15'x25'. The living room is the center most room of the home, and touches all other rooms. the front door is located on the south wall of the home. The western wall of the master bedroom is 15 feet. The southern wall is 20 feet.  The room is oddly shaped to afford a \u00e2\u0080\u009csort of\u00e2\u0080\u009d hallway on the eastern side of the room. This hallway is approximately 10 feet long by 4 feet wide. The room to the North of the Master bedroom is the common room.",
