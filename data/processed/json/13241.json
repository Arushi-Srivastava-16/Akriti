  "raw_text": "The first balcony is located in the northwestern corner of the floorplan. Its only bordering room is the kitchen to its east. The size of the balcony appears to be 36 or 6x6 square feet. The second balcony in the floor plan is located on its southeastern edge. The only room bordering it is the living room to the north. The area of the balcony appears to be 75 or 15x5 square feet. The bathroom is located in the northwestern corner of the floorplan. On its northern border sits the kitchen, the living room is located to the east, and the common room is bordering it to the south. The size of the room seems to be 48 or 8x6 square feet. The common room is situated in the western end of the floor plan. The master room is located to its south, the living room borders its eastern edge, and the bathroom sits to its north. I would estimate that the room is around 110 or 10x11 square feet. The kitchen is located at the northern end of the floor plan. Bordering the kitchen, there is the first balcony to the west, the bathroom to the southwest, and the living room to the southeast. The kitchen seems to be about 105 or 15x7 square feet. The living room is located all along the east side of the floorplan. It is bordered by every other room in the floorplan except the first balcony. I would estimate that the size of the living room is around 300 or 15x20 square feet. The master room is located in the southwestern corner of the floor plan. The living room borders it to the east, and the common room borders it to the north. The room appears to be around 130 or 10x13 square feet.",
