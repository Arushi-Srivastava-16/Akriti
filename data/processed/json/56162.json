  "raw_text": "The balcony is near the southwest corner of the home, directly to the south of the kitchen.  It borders the west wall.  It is about 2 feet by 3 feet, with a square footage of about 6 ft.  It has an aspect ratio of about 2:3. The bathroom is also near the northwest corner of the home.  It is to your right as you enter the door.  It is approximately 5 ft by 5 ft, with a square footage of approximately 25.  It has an aspect ratio of about 2:1.  It is to the south of the kitchen and also enters to the living room. The common room is in the south central area of the home.  It is to the west of the master bedroom and south and east of parts of the living room.  It is approximately 10 ft by 10 ft, with a square footage of 100 ft.  It has an aspect ratio of about 1:1.  It is square in shape and has an entrance to the living room. The kitchen is in the northwest corner of the home.  It has doorways leading to the living room, and the balcony and bathroom.  It is about 2 feet by 10 feet, with a 20 square foot area.  It has an aspect ratio of about 1:5.  It is directly to your right as you enter the front door. The living room spans from the northeast corner of the home to the southwest corner.  It splits the home into two, with the master bedroom and common room in the southeast corner, and the kitchen, balcony, and bathroom in the northwest corner.  It is oddly shaped and almost diagonal in shape.  It is approximately 10 ft by 20 ft in the southwest corner, and 20 ft by 10 ft in the northwest corner, with oblong shapes and hallways leading to each of the other rooms.  I would estimate the square footage of approximately 350.  It has an odd aspect ratio of approximately 3:4. The master bedroom is in the southeast corner of the home.  It is about 10 feet by 10 feet in width and length with a square footage of approximately 100 feet.  It has a doorway leading to the living room and the community room.  It has an aspect ratio of about 1:1.",
