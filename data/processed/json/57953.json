  "raw_text": "The balcony is directly south of the master room, roughly 15x3 feet (the same length east to west as the master above it). The bathroom is directly next to the kitchen and is around 6x10 feet. It is between the common room and the kitchen with no space between either. The common room is in the northeast corner of the home. I fills in the gap in the living rooms corner and otherwise, the north edge is in line with the north edge of the bathroom (west of it), and the east edge is in line with the east edge of the living room directly south of it. It is roughly 10x15 feet The kitchen is around 8x10 feet, directly north of the living room, with the west end in line with the west end of the living room. The living room lies at the center-most portion of the building. It measures roughly 30x20 feet (rounded up), but in the top right (northeast) corner there is a 10x5 chunk taken away from that space to be dedicated to the common room. There is an entryway to the home in the top right (most eastern north corner) of  living room. The master room is about 15x15 feet and lies south of the living room. The western edge of the master is in line with the western edge of the living room.",
