This balcony is small than balcony 1 as it is 5ftX5ft. continuing into the living room, once we pass the kitchen, lies the bathroom. Its and 8ftX8ft bathroom adjoined with a second common area Walking into the living room from the entry way there is an ajoining common room which is a perfect size for a game room or readingroom etc. it size is 12ftX12ft. This common a little smaller than the first common room. 10ftX10ft. the great thing about this common area is that is has its own balcony Next to the entry way on your right, as you walk in you'll also notice the open kitchen. The kitchen is 5stX10ftso a little narrow but it an open space to the living room. Once you enter the home you will have view of the living room. The living room is the center to the entire floor plan having access to all rooms. it is about a 24ftX12ft size room. walking out from the common room 2, back into the living room face south from the entry way door and you will find yourself looking at the master bedroom. it has a lot of space as it is 20ftX10ft. it also shares its east wall with a balcony",
