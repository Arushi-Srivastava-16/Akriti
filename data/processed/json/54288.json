  "raw_text": "The balcony is at the right side or end of the living room as you walk into the building. The living room could have access to the balcony, it seem logical. It is uncertain if the master room has access to the balcony as well. I would say the balcony is about 10 feet long and 3 feet wide. Bathroom one seems small but not different in size from the master room bathroom. Bathroom 1 could be around 6 feet wide and 6 feet long. It seem the living room has access to bathroom 1. Bathroom 2 is inside master room. Bathroom 2 is the same size as bathroom 1, 6x6 ft. Only master room has access to bathroom 2. Common room 1 looks like perfect 10 x 10 ft room and is slightly smaller than common room 2. It is unclear or hard to understand if common room 1 has access to bathroom 1 exclusively or if it is shared with the living room. Common room 1 is by or right next to common room 2. Common room 2 is slight bigger than common room 1, maybe a 10 feet wide and 12 feet long room. Neither common rooms seem to have extra storage space like master room. Common room 2 does not have access to a private bathroom. The kitchen appears to be very small about 6 feet wide and at most 10 feet long. The kitchen appears to be at your left hand side as you walk into the building. The kitchen looks separate from the living room, meaning it is closed off, not an open concept situation. The living room appears to be about 10 feet wide and about 25 feet long. The living room appears to the first room you walk into as you enter the building. The living room is the heart of the layout, with all additional rooms or spaces at it's surroundings. The master room also appears to have access to it's own private bathroom. The master room appears to be at the back of the building, with possibly access to a balcony to it's left. The master room seems to be about 10 feet wide and 10 feet long, with some extra space in what looks like a closet and window bed area at the opposite side of the room.",
