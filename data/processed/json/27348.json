  "raw_text": "The balcony, around 12ft east to west and 2.5 feet north to south, is located along the southernmost wall of the home to the east of the master room. A second bathroom is located in the northwest of the master suite and is approximately 7ft by 7ft. In the northeast corner is a full sized, approximately 16ft by 8ft bathroom adjoining the kitchen and the living room, with the east side twice the length of the north side. The common room is about 15 feet square, more than 200 square feet.  The first common room is located west of the living room. The second common room, somewhat smaller at around 120 square feet, 12ft east to west by 10 ft north to south is to the west of the master room and south of the main living area.  It is located directly north of the balcony. The kitchen is directly north of the living area and adjacent to the bathroom.  The kitchen is on the northern side of the house with around 30 square feet of area at around 4 ft north to south to around 8 ft along the northern side. The living room is the largest area in the house, with the master room and the common areas to the west and south and the main bathroom and the kitchen area to the west and north. The living area is approximately 20ft by 15ft with the entryway and the hall connecting to the master, expanding the living room area to more than 400 sq ft. The master room is the southwest corner of the house, with an en suite bathroom and a balcony to the east along the southern side.  Also adjacent to the master room is the hall extending from the living room connecting the master room and the two common rooms.",
