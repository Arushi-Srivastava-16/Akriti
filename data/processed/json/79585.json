  "raw_text": "oh yes, This balcony sits directly south of the master bedroom wall and is 2ftX10ft. Its main entrance is through the master bedroom. The bathroom is the smallest of all the rooms being about or less than 5ftX5ft. You'll notice that it adjoins with the master bedroom. Last but not least the common room. Great for entertainment or can be turned into another bedroom given its size of a 10ftX10ft room. This room is the farthest of all rooms located in the SW corner of the floor plan and is adjoined to the living room on its northern wall. The kitchen is one of the first rooms you see as you enter the doorway. It is a bit smaller than 10ftX10ft. Though it sits to the right of the doorway, the bathroom is paralle. It is adjacent to the living room making it to be an open space. The living is the center of the floor and is eye catching as you enter the room. It is as big as 20ftX10ft and is connected to all the rooms. You'll notice that you have added space in the living room as it is shaped in almost an L shape. The mast bedroom is a delight. It is 10ftX10ft room allowing for lots of space. It is adjoined by the bathroom and living room on the inner joining wall. North of the balcony.",
