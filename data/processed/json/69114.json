  "raw_text": "Balcony one is easily accessed off of the kitchen, offering views of the front entrance. Balcony 2 is located off of the living room, offering views of the rear of the home and is the larger of the two. Bathroom 1 is centrally located and easily accessible from the living area. Bathroom 2 is similar in size to the first bathroom and is located directly off of the master for ease of access. Common room is a bit small but tucked away to make it easily convertible to something else. The kitchen is located to the right of the entrance with its own access to the first balcony. It is rather small in size but offers the perfect location. The living room is located at the entrance of the home with access to all other rooms. Master is located right off the living room, next to the balcony with its own private bath. It is a good size, equaling half of the living room.",
