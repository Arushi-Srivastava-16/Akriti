  "raw_text": "The balcony is about 10x5ft and is located directly off of the master bedroom. Bathroom one is located to the right of the entrance, off the living room, and is roughly 5x5, making it the perfect guest space. Bathroom two is also about 5x5 and is located off of the master bathroom, offering private space. The common room is tucked away to the right of the living room, across from the master bedroom. This room is about 20x10ft, matching the living room in size, but is tucked away perfectly for it to be used for anything. The kitchen is only about 8ft long located in the far-left corner of the living room from the front entrance. The living room is about 10x20ft and is located at the front entrance. The master bedroom is about 10x10ft and has its own private bath and balcony to the right of the living room.",
