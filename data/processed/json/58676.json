  "raw_text": "The bathroom is on the western wall, wedged between the master room and common room 1, while still bordering the living room. This room is roughly 8 ft by 8 ft. Common room 1 sits on the northwestern corner and borders the bathroom and living room, and also adjacent to the kitchen. It is roughly 12 ft by 15 ft. Common room 2 is on the northeastern corner, bordering the living room and sitting adjacent to the kitchen. It is roughly 10 ft by 15 ft. The kitchen is on the northern wall. The kitchen is entered from the living room and sits adjacent to both common rooms 1 and 2. It is about 12 ft by 8 ft. The living room exits the house on the eastern wall, and borders each other room from the center. The room resembles a crucifix with many walls, making for a very roughly estimated area of 740. The master room is on the southwestern corner, bordering the living room and bathroom. It is roughly 180 sq ft.",
