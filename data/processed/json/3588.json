  "raw_text": "The balcony appears to be approximately 12 feet long and 2 feet wide.  It is located on the south side of the layout.  You can access the balcony from the master bedroom only. Bathroom 1 is likely an ensuite bathroom located adjacent to the master bedroom.  It is located on the south west corner of the layout. Bathroom 2 is between the kitchen and common room 2.  It is located on the north side of the layout.  It appears to be smaller than bathroom 1.  It could measure about 4 ft by 3 ft. Common room 1 is located on the south east side of the layout.  It is larger than common room 2.  It shares a wall with the master bedroom. Common room 2 is in the north west corner of the layout.  It is sharing an outside wall on two sides and a shared inside wall with the bathroom 2. It is smaller than common room 1. The kitchen looks small.  It might measure 10 feet long but it looks very narrow, maybe 3.5 feet wide.  This could mean it is a galley style kitchen. It is located in the north east corner of the layout. The living room is the biggest room in the layout.  It has outside walls to both the east and the west.   It is located in the center of the layout. The master bedroom is rectangular in shape.  It is located on the south side of the layout.  It shares a wall with a bathroom and a common room.  It also has an outside wall to the south.",
