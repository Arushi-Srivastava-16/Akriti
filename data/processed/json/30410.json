  "raw_text": "The very narrow balcony is approximately 15 feet by 1 foot, bordering the southernmost wall of the living room. Balcony 2 is a 5 by 4 feet rectangular shape, the same size as the bathroom. Hidden away behind the bathroom, it is very private. The 5 by 4 feet rectangular bathroom is located between the kitchen and the common room 2, on the west side of the living room. The 15 by 10 feet room is square ish and above the master bedroom. Its position makes it more private, away from the rest of the rooms. The common room 2 is a narrow but well sized bedroom, approximately 15 by 8 feet. The narrow kitchen is located immediately next to the entrance on the west side of the floor plan. It is just above balcony 2 and the bathroom. It is private and a separate space from the living room. The 15 by 25 feet living room is large and in the center of the floor plan, with the rest of the rooms located on either side. Its southern wall borders a long, narrow balcony. The 10 by 15 feet master bedroom is very large. Located on the east side of the floor plan, it only borders the living room and common room 1.",
