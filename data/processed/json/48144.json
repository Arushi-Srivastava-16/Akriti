The bathroom 1 is located opposite to the entrance door and is on the western side of the house. The estimated size of the bathroom 1 is 8 ft. x 6 ft. The bathroom 2 is also located opposite to the entrance door and is next to the bathroom 1. The estimated size of the bathroom 2 is 8 ft. x 6 ft. But it seems that it is attached to the master room. The common room 1 which is located at the north west side of the house will have a good cross ventilation since windows can be provided in both north and west side walls. The estimated size of the room is 14 ft. x 10 ft. The common room 2 which is located at the south east side of the house will have a good cross ventilation since windows can be provided in both south and east side walls. The estimated size of the room is 10 ft. x 12 ft. The kitchen is located at the north east corner of the house. If the cooking platform is constructed in the eastern side the sun shine will be directly on the kitchen in the morning time which will be fine for the kitchen.
