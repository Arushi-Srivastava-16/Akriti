  "raw_text": "The bathroom is the smallest room. Measuring at 5ftx5ft. It is located off the north west corner of the living room. Common room 1 is located at the south-western corner of the house. Similar in size to common room 2, it measures at 12ftx15ft. It lies between common room 2 and the master room. The north-west corner of the master room cuts into common room 1 by about 2ftx12ft. Common room 2 is centrally located on the western most side of the house. It measures at 15ftx12ft. It lies adjacent to common room 1 to the south and the bathroom to the east. The north-west corner of common room 1 cuts into common room 2 by about 2ftx10ft. To the west of the entry way is the kitchen. It is a narrow room, measuring 4ftx8ft. The kitchen is located on the north west corner of the northern section of the house that juts out past common room 2 and the bathroom. Entry to the house is to the living room from the north-east corner of the house. The living room is an unusual shape - on the east side of the living room is a long, straight wall, on the west side, the other rooms of the house jut out into the living room in a stair pattern with the widest part (20ft) being in the middle at the entry to common room 2 and narrowing by 5 feet at the bath at the north and common room 1 to the south. It narrows again at the kitchen at the north and a small part of the master room to the south. The living room is roughly 30ft long The master room is on the southern most part of the house, extending past the rest of the house by about 12 feet. The master room is a square room measuring 15ftx15ft. It shares a wall to the north with the living room and common room 1",
