  "raw_text": "Balcony 1 is about 10 feet wide. It is at the bottom of the floor plan. It is below the living room. It is to the left of the master bedroom, likely with sliding doors off of the master bedroom. Balcony 2 is a bit smaller than Balcony 1. It is attached to the kitchen, where the kitchen is below. Because the kitchen is so narrow, balcony 2 is smaller than balcony 1. It is technically the smallest space in the floor plan. The bathroom is the smallest room in the floor plan. It is attached to the right of the living room, and above the master bedroom, unattached. The common room is attached to the top of the living room. It is the third biggest room in the floor plan. It is also to the left of the kitchen. The kitchen is fairly small and narrow. It is attached to the balcony, which is above the kitchen. It is below the living room. The living room is the largest room in the floor plan. It is the central room. It is below the common room and to the left of the bathroom. The master bedroom is the second largest room in the floor plan. It is attached to the bottom of the living room. It also offers a ~10 FT balcony on the left hand side of the bedroom.",
