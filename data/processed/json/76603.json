  "raw_text": "The balcony is located on the southern side of the living room. It is fairly wide, measuring roughly 20x5 feet. It is only accessible by the living room and ends just before the master bedroom starts. Bathroom 1 is located next to the kitchen, it is left and straight from the front entrance. It's slightly larger than bathroom 2, roughly 10x10 feet in size. It's located between the kitchen and common room 1. This is the smaller bathroom directly tied to the master bedroom. It's maybe 10x5 feet or so, possibly smaller. It's tucked in between the master bedroom, it's closet, and common room 2 on the western side of the home. Common room 1 is the largest common room, only slightly smaller than the master bedroom, but this is due to the closet on the master. It is roughly 15x15 feet or so and located in the north western corner of the house. It is between bathroom 1 and common room 2. Common room 2 is the smallest room in the house, measuring roughly 10x10 feet or so. It is sandwhiched between common room 1 and bathroom 2.
