  "raw_text": "The balcony is south-facing and wide but narrow, about 10 feet by 2 feet. The 10 by 4 feet bathroom is located directly across from the entrance, nestled between the common room 1 and the master bedroom. With a small hallway, the bathroom is private. The common room 1 is slightly smaller than the master bedroom, about 8 by 10 feet. On the northern side of the floor plan, the common room is next to all the major rooms, including the kitchen and bathroom, making it less private than the other room. Nestled to the north-west of the floor plan, the common room 2 is similarly sized to common room 1, about 8 by 10 feet. Its position makes it much more private, only bordering the kitchen. The small kitchen is at the very top of the floor plan, in between the two common rooms. It is wide, about ten foot long, and narrow, only about two feet. The living room is at the very center of this floor plan, almost entirely encircled by other rooms. Decently sized, the 10 by 20 room provides access to all rooms. Located to the bottom right of the floor plan, the 10 by 12 foot room is private and hidden away.",
