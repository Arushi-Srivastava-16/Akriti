  "raw_text": "The small bathroom is immediately adjacent to the kitchen. About 8 feet by 3 feet, it is easily accessible from the living room. The common room is at the very bottom-left hand corner of the floor plan, meaning you have to traverse the entire living room to access it. It is about ten feet by ten feet. The kitchen is decently sized, about 10 feet by 5 feet. It is at the very top-right corner of the floor plan providing lots of privacy but little room to mingle. the long and narrow living room is at the center of the floor plan, giving access to all other rooms. It's approximately twenty feet by ten feet. The large master bedroom is approximately 12 feet by 15 feet. It is a large rectangle and is accessed via the living room.",
