  "raw_text": "The small bath is across from the bedroom on the east wall of the home. It is approximately 5 ft x 8 ft with the kitchen to the south and common room 2 to the north. Common room 1 is in the far north area of the home, It is centered on the plan but juts out about 2 feet from the wall on the west (master) and the east (common room 2) with a cantilever. It is approximately a 10ft x 10 ft square. Common room 2 is in the farthest north eastern area of the home, next to common room 1. It is approximately a 10ft x 10 ft square. The approximately 10 ft x 10 ft kitchen is enclosed in the south east corner of the front of the home, adjacent to the living room.  The one bath is to its north. The living room and kitchen expand the width of the front of the home, facing the south. You enter from a door almost in the center of the living area, directly into a 30.5ft x 10.5ft living room. It veers back into an area next to the bath to the east side and the master on the west.  Thus the living not a perfect rectangle with a space of approximately 5 feet between the corner of the master and the bath. The master bedroom is in the north west corner of the back of the home.  It does not expand the width of the living room as there is a cantilevered area  in the west area of the master.  The shape is relatively square, measuring approximately 10 ft x 12 ft. The master lies just north of the living room and is at the back of the home .",
