  "raw_text": "The balcony is located in the most northeast portion of the house. It is approximately 10 feet wide by 5 feet long. It is only connected to the living room to the south. Bath 1 is located in the northwest portion of the house, south of the kitchen. It is approximately 10 feet wide and 5 feet long. It is west of the living room, and north of bath 2. Bath 2 is located in the southwest portion of the house, north of the master room. It is approximately 10 feet wide and 5 feet long. It is west of the living room and south of bath 1. The kitchen is located in the most northwest portion of the house. It is approximately 10 feet by 10 feet in size, and located west of the living room and north of bath 1. The living room is located along the entire east side of the house, directly connected to all the other rooms in the house. The width of the living room is just over 10 feet, and the length is approximately 40 feet. About halfway through the living room it shifts slightly to the west side of the house, so the living room walls are not perfectly straight. The master room is located in the most southwest portion of the house. It is approximately 15 feet by 15 feet in size, including a small 1 foot by 1 foot hallway coming out of the northeast side of the room. The master room is east of the living room and south of bath 2.",
