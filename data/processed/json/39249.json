  "raw_text": "The balcony is about 24 sq feet and at the southern tip of the house. It's below the living room where you would be anle to access it. It does not border any other rooms The bathroom is only about 40-50 sq feet in size. It is at the far northwest corner of the house, joining with the living room. It runs down the corner about ten feet parallel to the first common room. The common room is located at the northwest corner of the house, with only the bathroom between it and the outside. It is approximately 100 sq feet and can be accessed through the top of the living room. This common room is located at the far northeast corner coming off of the living room. It is about 100 sq feet in size. Aside from the living room to the south of it, it has a kitchen bordering it to the left. The kitchen is far north side of the house. It is a small space located between 2 common rooms. It's probably no more than about 40 sq. feet. The vast living room is located primarily in the center of the house. It is easily large enough to be 40 percent of the house. It has a \"t\" shape to it. The living room can then lead to 6 different other rooms, including the balcony to the south. Along with 2 common rooms to the north, seperated by a kitchen. It also joins to a bathroom in the northwest corner and a master room in the southeast. The master room is located at the southeast corner. It is larger than all the other rooms, aside from the living room. The area of the room would probably be about 200 sq feet. The master room is only connected  to the living room and doesnt join with any other areas.",
