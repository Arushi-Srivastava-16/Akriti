  "raw_text": "The balcony is a 3ft by 12ft room at the rear of the house on the second floor just by the master bedroom doorway. Bathroom 1 is a full bath space of apox. 7ft X 7ft between the common room and kitchen. Bathroom 2 is a half bathroom joined to the master bedroom. Common room 1 is a common space of about 10ft X 10ft Common room 2 is a common space of about 12ft X 10ft The kitchen is about  5ft X 7ft and joins the living room separating the two common rooms and full bathroom from the living space. The living room is the largest room in the house and is located in the middle of the building with 3  hallways leading  to different areas of the house....actual size not counting the hallways i would say gives you a 15ft X 20ft living room space. The master room is one of the larger rooms in the house, with a private un-suite bathroom. Master room size would be about 10ft X 12ft space with the bathroom being a seperate 6ft X 7ft space.",
