  "raw_text": "The balcony is a small, narrow room that is presumably not a room at all, but an outdoor platform with a railing. The balcony only connects to the master bedroom and to no other rooms. The balcony is approximately 10 by 5 feet in size. Bathroom 1 is on the right side of the floor plan in the middle, towards the top. It is adjacent to a common area, the living room and the other bathroom. It is around 7 by 5 feet in size. Bathroom 2 is on the right side of the floor plan in the middle, towards the bottom. It is adjacent to the master bedroom, the living room and the other bathroom. It is around 7 by 5 feet in size. Common room 1 is in the bottom right of the floor plan approximately 12 by 15 feet in size. It is mostly rectangular, with a small additional rectangle towards the living room size. It is only adjacent to the living room. Common room 2 is in the top right of the floor plan. It is seemingly not a bedroom, but just an open space. It is adjacent to the living room, a bathroom and the kitchen. It is an irregular L shape approximately 10 by 15 feet with an extra bit going towards the living room. The kitchen is a small room in the top left of the floor plan. It is approximately 10 by 7 feet in size and it connects to the living room and the second common area. The living room is a large, irregularly shaped room in the center of the floor plan. It connects to every other room except for the balcony, and is approximately 15 x 30 feet in size.
