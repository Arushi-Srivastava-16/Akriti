  "raw_text": "The balcony connects to common room 2. It would seem as though it would be nice for an adult bedroom. Bathroom one shares a wall with bathroom 2. Seems to be about 7 feet by 7 feet, if that. Bathroom 2 shares a wall with bathroom one and the master bedroom. I assume it is inside of master bedroom. Considering it to be the master bathroom, but no bigger than the other bathroom. Common room one is shares a wall with the kitchen and the bathroom 1. It seems as though it's size could be useful for an office. It is about 12 feet by 10 feet. Common room 2 has a balcony attached, which is nice. It is a good size, I would say 15 feet by 10 feet. It would make a nice guest room. The kitchen is basically included in the living room area. I'm sure it's an open bar concert. But seems rather small. The living room seems to be the largest area of the house. It is about 25 feet by 30 feet. It also includes the kitchen it seems. The master bedroom is in the back corner of the house. It seems to be about 12 feet by 20 feet, give or take.",
